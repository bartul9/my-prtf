    <!-- Main section with big paragraf -->
    <main class="main"><p>My name is <b>Luka Bartulović</b>. I am 28 years old programmer from <b>Split, Croatia</b>. Whole my life I spent playing video games and using the computer to do fun things that I like. I am sad that I didn't learn programming before, but I am very happy that I started to learn it now.
<br><br>
      I started to learn programming in <b>November 2020</b>, and it changed my life. Finally, I have something that I love and enjoy doing. Before this I don't have any programming experience, and I finished Maritime High School which does not have any advanced mathematics or anything really related to programming. I started with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, and after I learned basics in those "languages" I moved to <b>JavaScript</b>. I really love and enjoy working with JavaScript, I am not a professional yet, but I'm on my way to be one. Also, I am very interested in <b>Cybersecurity</b> and backend programming which I plan to start learning when I have good knowledge of JavaScript.
      <br><br>
      Right now I am looking for a job as a <b>Web Developer</b>, so I can work and keep on learning new stuff while I'm working. I really want to learn new stuff and go really deep into programming, I want to play around with backend, server-side programming and later cybersecurity. How it all work's really interest's me, and I know that I will be doing this whole my life, because I really enjoy it. I spend more than 10 hours every day learning and programming, and also I am a <b>self-taught</b> programmer, everything I learned is from stuff that I found on the internet. Furthermore, I don't have too much experience yet, but I have great will to work and learn on the go. I have something that I love, and I will put all my mind to be as good as I can. If you give me opportunity to work for your company, I guarantee you it will pay off. 
      <br><br>
      My plan is to be a full stack developer who knows everything. I know it's a lot to take, but I really want to be able to create <b>backend</b> and <b>security</b>, and not just look's and front-end, cause it interests me so much, and I know in a two, three years I'll be excellent at it. You can check some of my project's that I built until now. It would probably be easy to just build stuff that everyone will like, and copy things from the internet. But honestly I like to create something new, and to play with code, when I'm able to.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for your time, and live long and prosper ✌️ </p></main>
